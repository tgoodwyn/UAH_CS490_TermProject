1) the platform you use for development:

Visual Studio 2019

2) the version of java / C# you tested with:

.NET 4.7.2, C# 7.3

3) any other info I need to test your software at home:

There's a "TestData.csv" file with the example data from the instructions in the top level directory. This data is, by default, displayed in the table. You can edit the data there. You can also save those edits, or load a new file (of type .csv). Whatever is in the table will be used by the simulator.

After setting the data you want in the table on the left, click "Start System" and the labels will update to show a simulation of the CPU executing processes with that data.

The "Pause System" button works.

The "Reset System" button works but you may need to click it multiple times to fully reset the system (this was not mentioned as a requirement so we did not make it perfect).
